\chapter{VCO Architectures}
\section{Taxonomy}
Common categories include ring VCOs, LC VCOs, and relaxation VCOs. Selection depends on target frequency, phase-noise budget, tuning range, power, and silicon area.
\section{Ring VCO}
Pros: compact, wide tuning, easy integration; Cons: higher phase noise, supply sensitivity. Frequency roughly \(1/(2Nt_p)\).
\section{LC VCO}
Pros: low phase noise, good spectral purity; Cons: larger area (inductors), narrower tuning. Frequency set by \(1/(2\pi\sqrt{LC})\).
\section{Relaxation VCO}
Pros: very wide tuning, simple concept; Cons: poor spectral purity for RF. Suitable for low-to-mid frequency timers.
\section{Comparison Guidance}
When phase noise is critical (RF synthesizers), choose LC. When area and wide range dominate (digitally controlled oscillators, on-chip clocks), choose ring. Hybrid strategies combine coarse digital banks with fine analog tuning.
